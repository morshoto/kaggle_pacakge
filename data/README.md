# Data directory

This directory is ignored by git (except this README and .gitkeep files). Store datasets and artifacts in the
standard subfolders below so every competition has the same layout.

## Structure

- `data/raw/`: Raw files downloaded from Kaggle (train/test/sample_submission, etc.)
- `data/processed`/: Final features ready for training/inference
- `data/submissions/`: Submission CSVs generated by src/submit.py
- `data/external`/: External datasets or resources

## Kaggle download

Install the Kaggle API and export credentials, then download competition data into data/raw/.

Example:

```bash
pip install kaggle
export KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_name
export KAGGLE_KEY=your_key
export COMPETITION=your-competition
python -m scripts.download
```

## Expected file names (example)

- data/raw/train.csv
- data/raw/test.csv
- data/raw/sample_submission.csv

Update these names as needed for each competition.
